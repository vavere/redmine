**Redmine Dashboard 2** is compatible and tested with Redmine 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 2.6. It may be compatible with older versions too.

## Install

### Ubuntu / Debian

I provide a PPA at [ppa:jgraichen/redmine-dashboard](https://launchpad.net/~jgraichen/+archive/redmine-dashboard) for Ubuntu Trusty that should work with Trusty's Redmine and [ppa:ondrej/redmine](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/redmine). Debian Wheezy with wheezy-backports enabled should also work with trusty PPA.

### Manual

1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/jgraichen/redmine_dashboard/releases).
2. Extract archive to `<redmine>/plugins`. Make **sure** the plugin directory is called `<redmine>/plugins/redmine_dashboard/` ([#11](https://github.com/jgraichen/redmine_dashboard/issues/11)).
3. Install required dependencies by running `bundle install --without development test` in your redmine directory. **Note**: Bitnami and other appliance are not officially supported and may need additional option e.g. `--path vendor/bundle` ([#58](https://github.com/jgraichen/redmine_dashboard/issues/58)).
4. A database migration is not needed. Restart redmine.

### Configure Redmine

1. Add the dashboard module to your project (`Settings > Modules`).
2. Configure dashboard permissions to your user roles (`Administration > Roles and permissions`). Users won't see a Dashboard tab without having the `View Dashboard` permission.

### Upgrade

1. Remove old plugin directory.
2. Follow installation steps for new release.

As of v2 you can also use git by cloning the repository and checkout the release tag.

## Contribute

I appreciate any help and like Pull Requests. The `stable-v2` branch is the current stable branch for v2. The next version, Redmine Dashboard 3, a complete rewrite is under development on the `master` branch. Please try to not add larger new features to current v2.

I gladly accept new translations or language additions for any version of Redmine Dashboard. I would prefer new translations via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/redmine-dashboard-2/) but you can also send a Pull Request. If you want to maintain a translation contact me via IRC (jgraichen at [irc://irc.freenode.net/redmine_dashboard](irc://irc.freenode.net/redmine_dashboard)) or email.
